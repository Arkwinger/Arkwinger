##  About
I explore the intersection of **cybersecurity, analysis, and experimental projects**, constantly learning and building things that help me understand systems more deeply.

My focus is on **hands-on problem solving** — breaking things down, experimenting, and improving through practical labs.

##  AI Projects & Interests
I study AI from a practical, experimental angle.  
Not theory — just **learning by building real models**.

Some of the projects I’ve created:

- **SMS Spam Classifier (NLP)**  
  A full preprocessing pipeline, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation.

- **Network Anomaly Detector (NSL-KDD)**  
  Random Forest model that classifies Normal, DoS, Probe, Privilege Escalation, and Access attacks.

- **Model Saving & Deployment Experiments**  
  Exporting `.joblib` models, running evaluations, and understanding how ML ties into problem-solving.

My interest in AI is simple:  
**I like building things, seeing how they work, and improving with each iteration.**
