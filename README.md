## 🧠 About
I explore the intersection of **defense, analysis, and threat intelligence** — using practical blue-team skills to understand and counter real adversaries.  
My work focuses on **incident response**, **forensic reconstruction**, and **building better visibility across systems**.  

Grounded in hands-on labs and attack simulations, I approach cybersecurity as both an investigation and an engineering discipline — where curiosity drives every discovery.
